# Devlog: 2025-07-29

## Progress
- Implemented a working CLI for the plumbbagel rules engine.
- Added support for running the engine as a module with `python -m plumbbagel`.
- Improved error handling (KeyboardInterrupt now prints a farewell message).
- Created a flexible rules file format (JSON) and updated the engine to match messages as dicts.
- Added example rules: 'fish' gets 'red', anything else gets 'blue'.
- Updated CLI and engine to wrap messages for rule matching.
- Added and tested a script (`scripts/fishtest.py`) to verify rule matching in code.
- Fixed packaging issues in `pyproject.toml` for uv and setuptools.

## Next Steps
- Expand rule syntax and matching capabilities.
- Add more tests and documentation.
- Improve developer and user experience.
