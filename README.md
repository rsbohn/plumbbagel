# plumbbagel

plumbbagel is a simple rules engine prototype. The project is currently 
under development and serves as a proof of concept. Expect rough edges and
rapid iteration.

## Goals
- Provide a lightweight rules evaluation engine.
- Experiment with flexible rule syntax.
- Serve as a playground for future improvements.

More documentation will be added as the codebase evolves.
